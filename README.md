### ‚ú® Key Features

This isn't just a static page. I've implemented several interactive features to create a unique user experience:

- **Interactive Hero Section:** A dynamic "spotlight" effect that follows the user's cursor, accompanied by a field of floating particles that react to mouse movement.
- **macOS-like Skill Dock:** The skills section features an interactive dock where icons magnify as the user's mouse passes over them.
- **Scrolling Timeline:** An animated timeline for my professional experience, where a scroll indicator moves in sync with the user's navigation through my career history.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Built with a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
