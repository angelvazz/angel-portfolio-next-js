Angel Vazquez - Interactive Personal Portfolio
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio. This is a fully interactive website built from the ground up to showcase my skills, professional experience, and key projects as a Full Stack Developer.

üöÄ Live Demo: angelvazz.github.io/angel-portfolio-next-js/

‚ú® Key Features
This isn't just a static page. I've implemented several interactive features to create a unique user experience:

Interactive Hero Section: A dynamic "spotlight" effect that follows the user's cursor, accompanied by a field of floating particles that react to mouse movement.

macOS-like Skill Dock: The skills section features an interactive dock where icons magnify as the user's mouse passes over them.

Scrolling Timeline: An animated timeline for my professional experience, where a scroll indicator moves in sync with the user's navigation through my career history.

Fully Responsive Design: Built with a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
